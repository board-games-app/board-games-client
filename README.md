![Board-Game-Image](https://i.imgur.com/VF64wkS.png)

## Description :smiley: 
Our app is a list of the most popular board games we can play. We aim to provide an extensive information to people who enjoy playing board games so they can decide which board game they can play next time they have a game night 

In the app, the user can:
- See the list of All Games
- See the description of each game
- Edit any game 
- Delete the game
- Add a new game 
- Search for any game by name
- Pick a random game
- Throw a dice 
- And do a test to see which game suits better

## Instructions to run locally :upside_down_face:
If the user wants to run this app locally, she/he should remember to install the different dependencies we used:
- npm install
- npm install -D tailwindcss 
- npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
- npm i daisyui react-daisyui  
- npm install axios
- npm install react-router-dom  
- npm i nodemon --save-dev  

Since the app is using environement variables, there is a file called .env with the "/*   /index.html   200" variable created so it is possible to redirect 

After installation of the previous, the user can run the app locally with the following command in the terminal:
- npm run dev
